/*
Given an array of elements in sorted order, (Assume integers) find whether there are 2 elements in the array that add up to a specific sum
 If they do, then print the numbers

 For e.g.
 given [1,2,3,4] and Sum =9, there are no solutions
 given [1,3,4,4,5,6] and Sum =11, there is one solution {5,6}
